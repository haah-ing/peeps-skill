# Peeps 👥

> _Your network is bigger than you think. Most of it is just invisible when you need it._

**Peeps** is an open-source agent skill that turns the people you know into a private, searchable record — kept on your machine, owned by you.

No CRM. No app. No feed. Just files and your AI agent.

## What it does

- **Remembers people** — one markdown file per person, everything you know about them
- **Surfaces context** — "remind me what Leo does before my meeting tomorrow"
- **Finds connections** — "who do I know in fintech in Singapore?"
- **Drafts intros** — "connect Peter and Shaurya, they should meet"

```

## Then just talk to your peeps

"Who do I know in hardware supply chain?"
"Remind me to talk to Basel next week"
"Draft an intro between Peter and Shaurya."
```

## The Dispatch

Peeps is local by default. But we can tap into close private network intellignce with Dispatch.

**Dispatch\* lets a small circle of trusted people share their networks insights — privately and consensually **without sharing any data\*\*. When your contacts don't have the answer, theirs might.
