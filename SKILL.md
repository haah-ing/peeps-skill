## Actions File
`~/people/actions.md` — the pending actions queue. Check this during morning briefings.
- **Catch-ups:** people Ilya wants to reconnect with. Add when he says "we should catch up" or similar.
- **Introductions:** intros to facilitate. Always include a pre-generated draft intro message (using ilya-belikin.md + both contact files for context). Format: `Person A → Person B — reason` followed by the intro text as a plain indented paragraph (no "Draft:" label, no quotes, no formatting).
- Move completed items to `## Completed` with a date.
- Keep it short — if it's not actionable, it shouldn't be here.

## Self-Entry
`~/people/ilya-belikin.md` is intentional — it's used as a reference profile for crafting introductions, bios, and context when introducing Ilya to others. Keep it up to date.

## Data Location
All contact files live in `~/people/` — **not** inside the workspace or skill folder.
On first use, create it: `mkdir -p ~/people/`
Keeping data outside the workspace ensures it persists across skill updates and reinstalls, and avoids mixing personal data with skill code.

## Dataset Config — `.peopleconfig.yml`
`~/people/.peopleconfig.yml` is the dataset config file. Read it at the start of any session involving this skill.

```yaml
owner: ilya-belikin       # slug of the owner's contact file (without .md)
enclave:
  id: null                # assigned by KYP cloud when registered
  api_key: null           # KYP cloud API key
  endpoint: null          # KYP cloud API endpoint
```

- **`owner`** — identifies whose dataset this is. Use this when constructing intros, bios, or any context where "the user" needs to be referenced by their contact file.
- **`enclave.*`** — KYP cloud credentials. When populated, the agent can push/pull enclave profiles and query the shared network. Until then, treat as local-only.
- If the file doesn't exist, operate in local-only mode and offer to create it.

### Enclave Profile — What Gets Synced
The enclave profile is the shareable subset of a contact file — describes the **person**, not your relationship with them.

**Shared to enclave:** Name, pronouns, location, Acumen, Interests, Bio, Intro willingness, Notes (freeform)
**Stays local:** Interaction history, Tags, Private Notes 🔒, Relationship/how you know them

### Sync Behavior
- **First sync:** always show all profiles for user audit before uploading anything. Store `last_sync` timestamp in `.peopleconfig.yml` after confirmation.
- **Ongoing:** weekly by default. Two modes set by user:
  - `review` — surface changes for approval before each sync
  - `auto` — sync without review
- **Manual push:** available on demand (e.g. after adding many contacts during active onboarding)
- Config keys in `.peopleconfig.yml`: `enclave.sync_mode` (`review`|`auto`), `enclave.last_sync` (ISO timestamp)

## Core Behavior
- User mentions a person → check if contact exists, offer to create/update
- User asks "who do I know in [domain/skill/location]?" → search by acumen, interests, location
- User asks about someone → surface their file with relevant context
- User wants to make an intro → draft it using both contact files + owner profile

## When User Mentions Someone
- "Had coffee with Maria" → log interaction, create contact if new
- "John's daughter is Sofia" → add to personal details
- "Sarah loves hiking" → add to interests/notes
- "Meeting with Tom tomorrow" → check calendar, surface Tom's context

## Creating a New Contact — Search First, Then Ask
Before asking follow-up questions, always search the web for the person (name + any context provided). Use what you find to pre-fill fields and make follow-up questions specific, not generic.

Example: "Found Peter on LinkedIn — design strategist, ex-Steelcase Asia Pacific in HK, now in SF. How do you know him, and is he open to intros?"

## Follow-Up Questions
After searching and pre-filling what you can, ask about the gaps:
1. **Relationship closeness** — How close are you? (e.g., close friend, acquaintance, professional contact, mentor)
2. **Open to introductions?** — Is this person open to being introduced to others? Any caveats?
3. **How you met** — if not already provided
4. **Last contact** — When did you last speak/meet?
5. **Interests** — hobbies, sports, lifestyle? (helps match people for non-work reasons)

Ask these as a short grouped follow-up (not one by one). Skip any that were already answered in the original message.

## Contact Structure
- One Markdown file per person: `maria-garcia.md`
- Sections: basics, relationship, personal details, interaction history, notes, private notes
- **Private Notes 🔒** section: for sensitive info (debts, conflicts, things not to share). Always separate from general Notes.
- Tags for grouping: #family #work #friend #neighbor #investor #advisor
- Keep it human-readable — this is about relationships, not data entry

## Key Fields To Capture
- Name, how you met, where they work/live
- **Relationship** (Close / Warm / Colleague / Acquaintance / Estranged / Family)
- **Intro willingness** (High / Medium / Low / Unknown)
- **Interests** — hobbies, sports, lifestyle (for non-work matching: running partners, travel buddies, etc.)
- **Acumen** — skills and expertise (for work/project matching)
- **Bio** — one concise narrative paragraph
- Birthday, anniversary, important dates → Notes
- Family members, kids, sensitive info → Private Notes 🔒

## Interaction Logging
- Date + brief note: "2024-03-15: Lunch, discussed her new job"
- Don't force structure — freeform is fine
- Recent interactions at top — most relevant for context
- Link to related contacts if group interaction

## Progressive Enhancement
- Start by creating contacts as they come up naturally
- Enrich over time: add acumen, interests, intro willingness as you learn more
- Periodically review sparse contacts and fill gaps
- Capture details during conversations — don't wait for a "data entry session"

## What To Surface Proactively
- "Meeting with Lisa in 2 hours" + her context + last topics discussed
- "Alex mentioned job hunting last time" — relevant context resurfacing
- "You haven't connected with Basel in a while" — if user wants relationship nudges

## Details Worth Remembering
- Kids/spouse names and ages
- Recent life events: new job, moved, health issues
- Preferences: vegetarian, doesn't drink, early riser
- Sensitive topics to avoid
- How you can help them / how they can help you

## What NOT To Suggest
- Syncing with phone contacts — different purpose, keep separate
- CRM-style pipeline tracking — this is personal, not sales
- Automated birthday messages — defeats the purpose
- Social media integration — privacy and complexity

## Folder Structure
```
~/people/
├── maria-garcia.md
├── john-smith.md
└── deceased/         # for people who have passed
```
All contact files live directly in `~/people/`. No subdirectories except `deceased/`.

## Search and Retrieval
Use `grep` for fast fuzzy scanning across all contact files:

```bash
# Find anyone matching a name or keyword (case-insensitive)
grep -ril "keyword" ~/people/

# Show matching lines with context
grep -i "keyword" ~/people/*.md

# Find by tag
grep -rl "#investor" ~/people/

# Find by company
grep -ril "hsbc" ~/people/

# Find open-to-intro contacts
grep -rl "Open to introductions.*Yes" ~/people/

# Full text search with filename
grep -iH "keyword" ~/people/*.md
```

For fuzzy/approximate matching, use `grep -i` (case-insensitive) as the first pass. For broader fuzzy search, pipe through `fzf` if available:
```bash
grep -rl "" ~/people/ | fzf
```

## Privacy Considerations
- This is sensitive data — keep local, encrypt if needed
- Cloud sync optional but consider privacy
- Git history shows evolution — consider if appropriate
- Some notes are for you only — don't share contact file

## Relationship Maintenance Prompts
- Offer to check on contacts not seen in X months
- Flag contacts with outdated info
- Suggest reaching out around their important dates
- "You mentioned wanting to introduce A to B" — track pending intros
